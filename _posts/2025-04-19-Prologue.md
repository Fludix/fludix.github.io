# Introduction
Heya! My name is Fludix and I don't think I need to introduce myself, right (^o^')7? You can check out my About page to find some information about me (^-^)/.

### Type of Articles
Anyhow, I just wanted to say that I'll be posting stuff of whatever comes to my mind. Some articles will be written as mere shitposts - don't worry I will put them in the shitpost category LMAO - but I will handle topics in the music, film and IT branch. Maybe even chemistry or politics, who knows?

### Reasons as to why this Blog exists
I want this blog to be a perfect site for others who are eager to read and learn. I'm eager to learn aswell - which is why I'm studying Informatics at the moment - though I want to teach others and enlighten their knowledge about specific fields they might not know of.

### Educational Channel
I also have a German IT educational channel called DEIMOS. If any of you are German speakers and visual learners, I suggest clicking this <a href="https://youtube.com/@deimosDE">Link</a> to learn better.
All of the documentation and tutorials I make will be uploaded to this blog. The first upload will hopefully happen in June 2025.
