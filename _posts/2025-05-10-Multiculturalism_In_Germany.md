## Introduction
Multiculturalism can be defined as cultural diversity or the evolution of it, where people from different ethnicities coexist. It can also refer to an integrative policy adopted by a multicultural nation. In Germany, multiculturalism can be seen every day. Every food is and tastes different, every way of making clothing is different and looks stunning and every behaivour of each individual is different. It makes our country colourful, joyful and not boringly monotone.

According to the book "**FOREIGN INFILTRATION VS IMMIGRATION COUNTRY**" by Ann-Kathrin Bartels and the "**Heidelberger Manifest**" released in 1981, it benefits the country for allowing immigrants with the same work experience to work in the same level as german citizens, but allowing immigrants to seek asylum can risk an enormous foreign infiltration and it could impact the country permanently. What really hides behind the facade of multiculturalism?

## Negative Aspects of Multiculturalism
Living in a multicultural society, even a cosmopolitan city for that matter, may instill a fear among individuals or minority groups, that they would lose their original ethnic identities or lifestyle. Being influenced by other cultures or foreign belief systems could create a protectionist tendency among citizens and could potentially bring division upon society.

In addition, the possibility of a social conflict occurs due to differences in religious beliefs and practices, ethnic rituals, or certain ways of life that may cause a seperation between groups. However, in those countries that have developed multiculturalism as a part of their country, there has been news that conflicts between groups and races arose mainly during financial crisis and due to lack of social programs.

## Positive Aspects of Multiculturalism
As I previously mentioned indirectly, multiculturalism impacts our way of living. People from other countries come to countries like Germany and spread their own traditional clothing, food and behavioral structure. By doing so, it helps us understand them and connect with them more so we can build a stable functioning society in Germany. Without connection, society would be no more.

Another thing is that there have been changes in the syllabus of subjects, like history, to accommodate a more comprehensive and broader version of the past events. This can be seen as giving more exposure to children, wherein they learn about different perspectives on a given topic. Kids are educated about equality, and thus develop an attitude against racism.

## Summary
At the end of the day, we may have our differences but we share one thing together, being human.
We should cherish our things and can share our individuality and traditions to others. I personally love multiculturalism, because I can experience every tradition in Germany without paying too much money to go to another country. At the same time, I also agree limiting asylum seekers to prevent things like foreign infiltration or mass instigation.

What makes some a German is someone who either lives in the country or was born in the country, goes to school or work, pays taxes and doesn't commit any crime or any commotion in our society.
