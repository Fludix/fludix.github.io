# Introduction
My name's Fludix and I'm from Germany. I was born on 22. October 2005 and I'm currently 19 years old. I specialise in Computer Science, Cybersecurity, IT-System Administration and IT-Forensics. Over the past year in IT, I've developed a versatile skillset of tech support, lifecycle management, repair, software, hardware, forensics, and data recovery.

# Projects I've done
**Project Watchdogs (2019 - 2020)**           - Kali NetHunter on a Google Pixel 4a with my own modified compiled kernel that had custom wifi drivers and HID access.
<br>
**DIY NAS (2020)**                            - I've built my own NAS which was used for Multimedia, Storing stuff and running servers.
<br>
**Horner Scheme Implementation in C# (2024)** - I implemented Horner's scheme on C#, so it can calculate and guess if the guessed root is actually a root (ex. f(2) = 0)
